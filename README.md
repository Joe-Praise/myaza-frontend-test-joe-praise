## Getting Started

Hello, welcome to BatMan's lair!

i'm Praise Joseph, but be sure to call me Joe.

Welcome to my coding submittion challenge from Myaza...üçæ

Aiit, lets get back shall we...

This was a challenge to build one of the most beautiful looking dashboard i've seen in a while.(Whomever designed this is Goated!)

Tech stack i used on the project were

- Nextjs & React
- Tailwind css
- Shadcn ui for charts
- Typescript to ensure its strictly typed
- Axios & Tanstack for API calls
- Lucide react for a limited number of icons
- Formik and Yup for form handling and validation

Application is mobile responsive. feel free to check that out.

Note: For the mobile view i opted out from using the basic hambuger menu. so if you look at the top left corner of your screen you'd see an icon. click it to reveal the nav bar.

I had fun running this one.

Till we meet again. Adios!

To run the application

- clone this project
- change .env.example to .env.local(Yeah. I AM BATMAN)
